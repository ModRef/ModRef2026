ModRef 2026 is the 25th in a [series of workshops on Constraint Modelling and
Reformulation](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~af9/ModRef/) organized as part of
CP 2026, the [32nd International Conference on Principles and Practice of
Constraint Programming](https://cp2026.a4cp.org/), held this year in Lisbon,
Portugal.  ModRef will be held on July 19th 2026, which is the day before the
main CP conference begins.  ModRef and CP are part of [FLOC
2026](https://flog26.org), a four-yearly co-location of conferences and
workshops related to logic in computer science.

The importance of modelling and model reformulation is widely recognised in many
domains, such as for CP, MIP, SAT, SMT and other kinds of general-purpose
solvers. There has been significant research effort in recent years into
modelling and model reformulation, such as automating techniques used by expert
modellers, and developing tools and techniques to target multiple types of
solvers from one model.

The purpose of ModRef is to be a forum for all kinds of work in modelling,
including new models or new modelling ideas for any amenable problem (whether a
new application or a classic benchmark), reformulation techniques to improve the
performance of models when solved by general-purpose solvers, and automated
modelling techniques, tools, and languages. We solicit original papers that
contribute to the understanding of modelling or model reformulation.

Workshop topics include:

- Application papers describing interesting problems and interesting ways to
  model them;
- Contributions to understanding modelling that could guide the manual or
  automatic formulation of models;
- Identification of the criteria that should be used in evaluating models and
  the design of pragmatic techniques that facilitate the choice and possible
  combination among alternative models;
- Design of higher-level modelling languages;
- Automatic reformulation techniques; and
- Techniques which allow automatically targeting multiple kinds of solvers from
  a single declarative model.

## <a name="callForPapers"></a> Call for Papers 

This year ModRef will again accept paper submissions. In addition to the
presentation of research results, we especially welcome submissions of novel
(ongoing) work, recent breakthroughs, future directions, and descriptions of
interesting aspects of existing systems.

There are three types of paper submissions: extended abstracts (at most two
pages), short papers (at most eight pages) and long papers (at most fifteen
pages). References are not part of the page limit. Papers are submitted through
[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=a4cp.org/CP/2025/Workshop/ModRef)
as PDF files following [LIPIcs
guidelines](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author). There is no
requirement for papers to be anonymised before submission.

We also accept (and encourage) non-traditional electronic submissions, such as
interactive works/tool demonstrations. In this case, please contact the chairs
to discuss the suitability of your submission for ModRef.

All submissions will be reviewed, and those that are well-written and make a
worthwhile contribution to the topic of the workshop will be accepted for
publication in the workshop proceedings, which will be available electronically
on this website. Accepted contributions will be allowed a time slot for a
presentation at the workshop.
